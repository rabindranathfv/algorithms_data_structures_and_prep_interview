 * LeetCode #121 — Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
 *
 * Given an array `prices` where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i,
 * return the maximum profit achievable by buying on one day and selling on a
 * later day. Return 0 if no profit is possible.
 *
 * Example:
 *   maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]) // 5  (buy at 1, sell at 6)
 *   maxProfit([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])    // 0  (prices only fall)
 */
export function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  // TODO: implement
  return 0;
}
